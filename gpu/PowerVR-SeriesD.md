## Notes

* Level 4 ray tracing. [1]
	- its mean BVH traversal and full coherency sorting in hardware

* Fragment Shading Rate (FSR, *same as VRS or fragment density, not a AMD's FSR*) [2]

* 2D Dual-rate texturing allows post-processing effects in DXT to run much more efficiently, effectively increasing the performance of denoising.
