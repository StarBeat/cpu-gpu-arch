## Features

* DLSS 4, Multi Frame generation.
* GDDR7.
* PCIe Gen5.
* Tensor core with FP4 format.


## Notes

* SM architecture doubles INT32 bandwidth and throughput by enabling all shader cores to execute INT32 or FP32 instructions. [2]
	- Not supported parallel i32 and fp32 like in Turing.

* Shader Execution Reordering enhances the efficiency of shaders generating work for other shaders by doubling throughput. [2]
* Fourth-generation RT cores feature a triangle cluster intersection engine for efficient mega geometry processing. They include a compression format and lossless decompression engine for more efficient handling of complex scenes. [2]

* The shared memory capacity can be set to 0, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 100 KB. [1]
* Devices of compute capability 12.0 allow a single thread block to address up to 227 KB of shared memory. [1]

* doubles the performance of point-sampling textures per cycle compared to Ada. [3]
	- used in Stochastic Texture Filtering.

* Pixel Fill-rate (Gigapixels/sec) decreased from 443.5 (on RTX 4090) to 423.6. [3]
* RT TFLOPS increased from 191 (on RTX 4090) to 317.5 (+66%). [3]

* RT Core:
	- include a dedicated unit known as the Opacity Micromap Engine. [3]
	- includes a Triangle Cluster Intersection Engine, which further accelerates ray tracing of Mega Geometry. [3]
	- adds Linear Swept Spheres as a hardware-accelerated path to ray trace fine geometry like hair. [3]

* added floating point instructions to uniform datapath. [4]
	- include adds, multiples, FMAs, min/max, and conversions between integer and floating point.
