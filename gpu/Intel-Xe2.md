## Notes

* Parallel FP32 FMA and I32 IADD datapath. [1.3]
* Each Xe Core has eight TMUs, or texture samplers in Intel terminology. The samplers have a 32 KB texture cache, and can return 128 bytes/cycle to the XVEs. [1.3]
* L1 latency for a SIMD1 (scalar) access is about 15 cycles faster than a SIMD16 access. [1.3]
* SIMD32 accesses take one extra cycle when microbenchmarking, though that’s because the compiler generates two sets of SIMD16 instructions to calculate addresses across 32 lanes. [1.3]

* SIMD16 native ALU, support SIMD16 and SIMD32 ops. [1.5]
* Tensor core (Xe Matrix Engine) supports: FP16, BF16, int8, int4, int2. [1.5]
* 64bit atomic ops. [1.5]
* 2x throughput for sampling without filtering. [1.5]
* Out of order sampling with compressed textures. [1.5]
* Early HiZ culling of small primitives. [1.5]
* Render target prefetch to L2. [1.5]
* New 8:N compression. [1.5]

* In Xe2, Intel added the “Large GRF” mode which allows a thread to pick between 128 registers or 256 registers. [3.1]

# Intel Xe3

CPU code name: Panther Lake<br/>

## Specs

* Xe Core (EU): [3.1]
	- 8x 512 bit Vector Engines (XVE)
	- 8x 2048 bit XMX Matrix Engines
	- 256KB shared L1 / SharedMemory(SLM)
	- 128 fp32 FLOPS/cy

## Notes

* one of the big changes in Xe3 is making the render slice capable of handling up to 6 Xe Cores from the 4 Xe Cores that the Xe2 render slice could support. [3.1]
* the amount of compute throughput that Xe3 has not changed compared to Xe2 with the same 8 512 bit Vector Engines and 8 2048 bit Matrix Engines per Xe Core but the L1/SLM capacity has increased from 192KB to 256KB. [3.1]
* Xe3 now allows a thread to allocate up to 256 registers in 32 register increments. [3.1]
* ray tracing units now capable of dynamic ray management. [3.1]
