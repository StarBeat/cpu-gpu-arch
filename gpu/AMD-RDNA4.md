## Features

* Tensor Core with fp32, fp64, fp16, bf16, i8, i4, **fp8, bf8** formats.
* Ray tracing with oriented bounding boxes (OBB).
* Dynamic registers.

## Notes

* introduces new SWMMAC (Sparse Wave Matrix Multiply Accumulate) instructions to take advantage of sparsity. [1]

* Shaders have the option to allocate registers dynamically. [3]
	- Compute Shaders may be launched in a mode where they can dynamically allocate and deallocate VGPRs; [2]
	- dynamic VGPRs is not supported for graphics-shaders. [2]
	- Dynamic VGPRs are supported only for wave32, not wave64. [2]
	- if any workgroup is using dynamic VGPRs, only dynamic VGPR enabled workgroups or waves may be running on that WGP. [2]
	- Dynamically allocating VGPRs can lead to deadlock when all VGPRs have been allocated but every wave needs to allocate more VGPRs to make progress. [2]

* fp32 scalar ops. [3]
	- The SALU supports a set of floating point operations to offload uniform value calculation from the VALU pipe. [2]
	- fp32 ops: add, sub, min, max, mul, ceil, floor, trunc, round, fma, cmp, conversion. [2]
	- fp16 ops: add, sub, min, max, mul, ceil, floor, trunc, round, fma, cmp. [2]

* LDS: [2]
	- 64 banks, each with 512 entries of 4 bytes
	- A single work-group may allocate up to 64kB of LDS space.
	- The shared memory contains 64 integer atomic units to enable fast, unordered atomic operations.

* Ray tracing instructions: [2]
	- Box BVH nodes perform 4x Ray/Box intersection, sorts the 4 children based on intersection distance and returns the child pointers and hit status.
	- Triangle nodes perform 1 Ray/Triangle intersection test and returns the intersection point and triangle ID.
